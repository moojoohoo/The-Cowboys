        <p>The Cowboys played awful. They made 18 errors, missed 42 tackles, and conceded 7 penalties, which are all leading the league. The Panthers, on the other hand, made 17 errors, missed 16 tackles, and conceded 3 penalties. Kurt Capewell scored a quick try, but the rest of the first half was tryless. The Panthers were up 8-0 at halftime. Then,  Dylan Edwards, Brian To'o, and Isaah Yeo all went over in a ten minute period to win the game for the Panthers. The Panthers won 24-0. </p>

        <p>Both teams played okay. Jason Taumalolo's injury really hurt the Cowboys. Coen Hess went over in the second minute off of a beautiful kick from Jake Clifford. Mikaele Ravalawa went over in the tenth minute and Josh Kerr in the twenty-seventh minute for the Dragons. Corey Norman kicked a field goal on the half-time buzzer. Dragons were up on the break, 13-6. Valentine Holmes then scored seven minutes after half-time off of a little grubber he put in himself. Ben Hunt went in on the fifty-third minute to keep the Dragons at a comfartable lead. The Cowboys quickly struck back with Jake Granville going in just four minutes after Ben Hunt. Zac Lomax then went over in the sixtieth minute to keep the Dragons at an comfartable lead. Dragons then defended for next twenty minutes to win, 25-18. </p>
