        <p>The cowboys played pretty good. They scored quite a few good tries and had pretty solid defense. Reece Robson played a great game scoring two trys. The titans didn't do the best in defense or offense. </p>

        </table>
        <p>The cowboys didn't play great. We needed to defend Jesse Ramien and Ronaldo Muitlino better. We had some good trys like Kyle Feldt's 65 metre try and Justin O'neill's good kick chase but not enough for the cowboys. The sharks had pretty solid defense and attacking offense.

        <p>The cowboys did okay. They scored some great trys like Valentine Holmes' nice catch and Hamiso Taubai-Fidow's quick hands to Justin O'Neill to score. The warriors' Peta Hiko scored a hat-trick which supported the warriors win.</p>

        <p>The Tigers where unstoppable in the first half scoring six trys. The Cowboys Didn't do very well due the absense of Valentine Holmes and Michael Morgan. The Cowboys inproved in the second half scoring four trys but that wasn't enough.</p>
